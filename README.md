# PROJECT NAME
Hospital-Data-Analysis

# OVERVIEW
Designed and developed interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize hospital performance metrics, enabling leadership to identify key trends and improve decision-making processes. Analyzed patient admission, discharge, and treatment data to identify pattern, ensuring accuracy and consistency across multiple data sources.Created complex DAX measures and calculated columns to analyze trends and deliver actionable insights.

# DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT
This project involves a detailed analysis of hospital data from 2018 to 2021,this data is of 4 year of data focusing on inpatient and outpatient and day cases. In powerBI desktop after get data we transform and load the data in power query editor. Then we use append query on inpatient and outpatient data. We perform some functions like trim, proper, remove blanks error. we also buid a relationship between hospital data and mapping speciality in model view. And also perform some DAX function. The dataset includes key metrics such as patient visit dates, specialties (e.g., Neurology, Dermatology, Cardiology), case types (Inpatient, Outpatient, Day Case), and patient age groups (0-15, 16-64, 65+). The key steps involved in the report creation are as follows:

Step 1: Key Metrics Cards - 
Total Patients: 21 million,
Average Patients per Day: 57,
Total Patients in the Past Quarter: 2 million,
Total Regular Patients in a Quarter: 6 million.
These key figures are displayed using dynamic cards to give an overview of the hospital's patient intake.

Step 2: Interactive Slicers - 
Four interactive slicers were implemented for a customized experience:
Age Profile: 0-15, 16-64, 65+, 
Specialty Group: Including Bones, Blood, Brain, Cancer, etc,  
Case Type: Inpatient, Outpatient, Day Case, 
Archive Date: Data spanning from 2018 to 2021. 
These slicers allow users to filter and drill down into specific categories for deeper insights.

Step 3: Visualizations - 
Line Graph: Shows the relationship between case type and total/average patients, providing a trend over time.
Bar Chart: Displays total and average patients by age profile and specialty name (e.g., Orthopedics, Dermatology, Neurosurgery),specific age groups.
Donut Chart: Represents the distribution of case types, with Outpatient making up 72%, Inpatient 10%, and Day Case 17%.
In this project I perform the process of Data requirement, Data cleaning, Data maodelling, Data analysis, Data visualization and Report Making. This detailed and interactive Power BI report helps stakeholders understand hospital operations, patient demographics, and specialty-wise trends, aiding decision-making and resource allocation.
